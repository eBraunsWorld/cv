            <h1>About Me</h1> 
                <p>Hi, I'm Erik, originally from Detroit, MI. I've always been a lifelong athlete with a keen interest in computers and technology from a young age. Initially, I had plans to major in Computer Science, but my sports background and frequent injuries led me to switch gears and pursue a degree in Athletic Training.</p>

                        <h2>Education & Experience</h2>    
                            <p>I graduated in 2019 from Grand Valley State University with a Bachelor's degree in Athletic Training. After graduating, I embarked on an exciting journey working in professional baseball as an athletic trainer for the Milwaukee Brewers and Houston Astros for a total of 3 years. During this time, I gained valuable experience in injury prevention and rehabilitation initiatives while still retaining my love for technology.</p>
                            <p>To further expand my skillset and knowledge in the technology field, I delved into learning programming languages and mastering the intricacies of different technologies. This allowed me to maximize my efforts in injury prevention and rehabilitation, using cutting-edge technological solutions.</p>
